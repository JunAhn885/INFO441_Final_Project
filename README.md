# Human Outsourcers: RSO Member Management App

By Jun Ahn, Patricia Ma, Scott Nguyen, and Jack Sui.

**For developers:** also read [development notes](DEVELOP.md).

## Project Description

Our target audience for the club member management app is college RSO officers
and administrators. We envision club officers to use our applications to easily 
manage various member status such as attendance, dues, membership status, etc.

Our audience will choose our application over their previous management methods
because we noticed that many RSOs track their attendance, club dues and
activities with Excel or other manual ways, which are not created for human
management purposes. We want to build a system that is actually useful for
current RSO's leaders to better manage their organizations and to save time
while doing so.

As a developer and a student, many of us are part of the RSOs on campus.
Based on our experiences, we observed that many RSO's on campus have a difficult
time managing members as they are either using excel or platforms not suitable
for member management.
