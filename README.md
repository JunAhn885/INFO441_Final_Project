# RSO Member Management App
Patricia Ma, Scott Nguyen, Jun Ahn, Jack Sui 

## Project Description
Our target audience for the club member management app is college RSO officers and administrators. We envision club members and club officers to use our applications to easily manage various member status such as attendance, dues, membership status, etc. Our audience will choose our application over their previous management methods because we noticed that many RSOs track their attendance, club dues and activities with Excel or other manual ways, which are not created for human management purposes. We want to build a system that is actually useful for current RSO’s leaders to better manage their organizations and to save time while doing so. As a developer and a student, many of us are part of the RSOs on campus. Based on our experiences, we observed that many RSO’s on campus have a difficult time managing members as they are either using excel or platforms not suitable for member management.
